config.main.header=#\n# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the\n# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.\n# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.\n# In particular, see \n# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>\n# for a discussion of each configuration directive.\n#\n# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding\n# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure\n# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  \n#\n# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many\n# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the\n# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin\n# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/access_log"\n# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache2" will be interpreted by the\n# server as "/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log", whereas "/logs/access_log" \n# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.
config.main.server-root.comment=#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point\n# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the\n# Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the\n# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at\n# least PidFile.\n#
